            This also requires preventing wars, and mitigating (technologically enabled) abuse of power.
            We believe that almost all people want peace and that wars are enabled by the abuse of power of representatives and the lack of effective coordination.
            In 1946, after having contributed to the >50 million deaths of world war 2, awaiting his execution, Hermann GÃ¶ring, a leading member of the Nazi Party shared his views on the causes of war:
        </p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p>"Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia, nor in England, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Assuming this to be true, preventing wars is simply a question of effective coordination among all people.</p>

    <section class="solution">
        <p>In order to have peace, there needs to be effective enforcement of international rules.</p>
        <p>The global, real time decentralised coordination platform <a href="https://stated.ai">stated.ai</a> can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>enable faster and more frequent negotiation among many groups of organisations (government or otherwise)</li>
            <li>provide increased transparency and public scrutiny on the actions of representatives</li>
            <li>greatly improve the reaction time, precision and increased participation of collectiverule enforcement action</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To enable coordination, stated.ai estabilshes online identities through a web of a many transparent independent verifications among it's members.</p>
        <p>Once established, these highly reliable online identities then enable collective contract signatures and polls, which then facilitate the negotiation and enforcement of rules.</p>

        <h2>How to get there?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Help companies, local governments and Nont Profit organisations 
                to coordinate more effectively on a global scale using <a href="https://stated.ai">stated.ai</a>. 
                If reliability, resilience, transparency and effectiveness have ensued, then national governments should follow the adoption of stated.ai.
            </li>
            <li>Enable individuals to express their views in real time using <a href="https://ip-vote.com">ip-vote.com</a>.
                This enables the public to signal misrepresentation and abuse of power.</li>

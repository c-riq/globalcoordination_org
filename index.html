    <h1>Ending Wars Through Global Coordination</h1>

    <section class="intro">
        <p>We aim to achieve what the UN has failed at: To end wars and protect human rights.</p>
        <p>Almost all people want peace. Wars are enabled by the abuse of power of representatives.</p>

    <section class="historical-context">
        <p>In 1946, after having contributed to the >50 million deaths of world war 2, awaiting his execution, Hermann GÃ¶ring, a leading member of the Nazi Party shared his views on the causes of war:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p>"Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia, nor in England, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>If this is in fact true, then preventing wars is simply a question of effective coordination among all people.</p>

    <section class="solution">
        <p>In order to have peace, there needs to be effective enforcement of international rules.</p>
        <p>The global, real time decentralised coordination platform stated.ai can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>enable faster and more frequent negotiation among many groups of organisations (government or otherwise)</li>
            <li>provide increased transparency and public scrutiny on the actions of representatives</li>
            <li>greatly improve the reaction time, precision and increased participation of rule enforcement action</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To enable coordination, stated.ai estabilshes online identities through a web of a many transparent verifications among its members.</p>
        <p>These highly reliable online identities in place then enable collective contract signatures and polls, which then facilitate the negotiation and enforcement of rules.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="roadmap">
        <h2>How to get there?</h2>
        <p>Help companies, local governments and Nont Profit organisations to coordinate more effectively using stated.ai. If reliability, resilience, transparency and effectiveness ensue, then national governments should follow.</p>

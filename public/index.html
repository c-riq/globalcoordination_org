            Preventing wars, and mitigating abuse of power are essential steps towards a world where human rights are respected.
            How is it possible that nations still fight wars?<br/>
            We believe that most people want peace and that wars are fundamentally enabled by the abuse of power and by the lack of effective coordination.
            In 1946, after having contributed to the >50 million deaths of world war 2, Hermann GÃ¶ring, a leading member of the Nazi Party shared his views on the causes of war:
        </p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p>"Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia, nor in England, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Assuming this to be true, preventing large scale wars requires highly effective coordination among all people.</p>

    <section class="solution">
        <p>In order to have peace, there needs to be effective enforcement of international rules.</p>
        <p>The global, real time decentralised coordination platform <a href="https://stated.ai">stated.ai</a> can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>enable faster and more frequent negotiation among many groups of organisations (government or otherwise)</li>
            <li>provide increased transparency for public scrutiny on the actions of representatives</li>
            <li>greatly improve the reaction time, precision and increased participation of collective rule enforcement</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To enable coordination, stated.ai establishes online identities through a web of many transparent independent verifications among it's members.</p>
        <p>Once established, these high confidence online identities then enable collective contract signatures and polls, which then facilitate fast paced negotiation and enforcement of rules.</p>

    <section class="roadmap">
        <h2>How do we get there?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Help companies, local governments and non-profit organisations 
                to coordinate more effectively on a global scale using <a href="https://stated.ai">stated.ai</a>. 
                If reliability, resilience, transparency and effectiveness have ensued, then national governments should follow the adoption of stated.ai.
            </li>
            <li>Enable individuals to express their preferences in real time using <a href="https://ip-vote.com">ip-vote.com</a>. Where every IP address can be used to vote once for each poll. 
                This can be a good proxy for popular opinion in order to demonstrate abuses of power.
                However this requires correcting for manipulation attempts and uneven distribution of IP addresses.
                Manipulation attempts can be mitigated by 
                <ul>
                    <li>Analysing results from VPN, TOR network and Cloud Provider IP addresses separately</li>
                    <li>Verifying the approximate geolocation by network latency triangulation</li>
                    <li>Allowing only one vote per /64 block for IP v6 Addresses</li>
                    <li>Cross checking results across IP blocks from different Internet Service Providers</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
